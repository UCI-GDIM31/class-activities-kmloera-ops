"Hello World!"

### W2
The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of the others because we need a number not a string or bool. Then the reason we use floats instead of integers is because rgb variables will not always be whole numbers so to use fractional amounts we use a float instead. The reason the _bounce variable is an integer instead of a bool and string is because it is a number. Then the reason it is an integer instead of a float is because it is only adding 1 and not anything else that makes it float/decimal/fraction. In step 4, it showed that the operations will absolutely not work unless you add a semi-colon after the operation.

{
	Float Light_level = 100 * x;
