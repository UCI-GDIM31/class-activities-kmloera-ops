The r, g, and b variables are floats instead of the others because we need a number not a string or bool. Then the reason we use floats instead of integers is because rgb variables will not always be whole numbers so to use fractional amounts we use a float instead. The reason the _bounce variable is an integer instead of a bool and string is because it is a number. Then the reason it is an integer instead of a float is because it is only adding 1 and not anything else that makes it float/decimal/fraction. In step 4, it showed that the operations will absolutely not work unless you add a semi-colon after the operation.

Void SetLightDimness (float x)

1. A metaphor for classes and components is Russian nesting dolls. This is due to the hierarchy such as the first being a scene, then inside is the game objects, then components, then scripts, then monobehavior, then classes, and finally member variables and methods inside the classes. Each is nested within each other, and to access something outside of itself it needs to be connected to it like a class accessing a component.
2. I think the reason they get extremely bright is because there is no limit on how bright they can get so they just keep going until they can’t go further.
